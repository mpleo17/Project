<h3 align = "center" color = Blue>Project Summary:</h3>
<h3>Project1 is about the price prediction of used cars. The algorithms used for prediction include Multiple Linear Regression, Decision Trees and Random Forests Regressor. 
There are three parts of this project</h3>
<ul>
<li>PART1: Loading and data wrangling: This part deals with challenges like missing values and wrong data types assigned to variables that are found in real world datasets.</li>
<li>PART2: Exploratory Data Analysis: This part is used to identify the significant independent variables that affect the target variable.</li>
<li>PART3: MLR and DTR and RFR: This part consists of appliation of three different machine learning algorithms and their evaluation using MSE.</li></ul>


<h3>Project2 is about the prediction of possibility of subscription by users. A business decision is required to make for conducting telephonic drive only for the targeted individuals who have the maximum probability of subscribing to the plan.</h3>
<ul><li>Classification techiniques involving Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier and Decision Tree Classifier are used to classify individuals. The evaluation is done using accuracy of classification.</li></ul>
