<h3 color = Bu >Project Summary:</h3>
<p>
  <ol>
    <li><b>Project1</b> is about the price prediction of used cars. The algorithms used for prediction include Multiple Linear Regression, Decision Trees and Random Forests Regressor. 
     There are three parts of this project.</p>
<ul>
<li>PART1: Loading and data wrangling: This part deals with challenges like missing values and wrong data types assigned to variables that are found in real world datasets.</li>
<li>PART2: Exploratory Data Analysis: This part is used to identify the significant independent variables that affect the target variable.</li>
<li>PART3: MLR and DTR and RFR: This part consists of appliation of three different machine learning algorithms and their evaluation using MSE.</li></ul></li>

<p>
  <li><b>Project2</b> is about the prediction of possibility of subscription by users. A business decision is required to make for conducting telephonic drive only for the targeted individuals who have the maximum probability of subscribing to the plan.</li></p>
<ul>
  <li>Classification techiniques involving Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier and Decision Tree Classifier are used to classify individuals. The evaluation is done using accuracy of classification.</li></ul>
